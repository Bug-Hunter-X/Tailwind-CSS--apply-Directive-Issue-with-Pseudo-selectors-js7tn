This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector like `:hover` or `:focus`.  The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly apply the styles when the pseudo-selector is present, resulting in the styles not being applied at all.

```css
/* bug.css */

.button {
  @apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700;
}
```
